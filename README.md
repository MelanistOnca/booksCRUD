# booksCRUD: wanna-be Goodreads

# Gist

This app will allow you to add users, books, and authors to their respective tables. `what about psuedonyms?!`

There will be a join table with ids from each of the above, plus a column for 'is read' so that you can keep track of books you have read, and books you would like to read.

If you happen to like a book by an author, you would also be able to filter by that author to find other titles by them. `unless maybe psuedonyms makes that tricky`
